## Short Story of me..
    When I started university, It takes me very long time to understand "What is Electrical & Electronics Engineering". And this question make another question. What I want when i became in E&E Engineer ? For long time, I searched everthing i can find. That means i look internet and contacted senior or expert level E&E Engineers. I was talked a lot of things for opportunities to find best field for me. During the time, I was tried some different things which is find interesting. Firstly i use Arduino. It was fun but not professional for future big applications. It's just hobby for me. Than i realized another big problem of earth, power transmission, power distribution and generation makes me really curios. This field giving engineers very big job opportunities. Scientific calculations, solving real world energy problems etc.. But it's not for me. Because i realized it's not what i looking for. Makes me sad. And after long time, i saw myself really interesting about machine's working system. Than i told myself: That's it ! I found whats the biggest curios for me. Automation Systems. And my story just begin...

## You can find here the biggest projects I worked and studied for..
    In 2018, when i was long term engineer intern our team worked very big projects at the INCI BATTERY.

    1st : BATTERY CHARGE & DISCHARGE MACHINE (INCI BATTERY)
    For this machine my contribution is very helpful for my working team. I did myself all board connection myself. This machine has 37 copy itself. It was hard but it was worth to do it. We use S7-300 PLC. I write a little code with ladder diagram but important things of machine safety. 
    Me and engineer team mate run all sensors, buttons, valves, connection protocol, connection hardware and safety I/O tests. When we managed to run safely and successfully the machine I/O, we started real battery tests. Charging tests. When all the test run successfully our team worked this 37 machines's connecting system. 2 conveyor belt and 2 robot. These conveyor belt's and robot's task, must reach batteries equally and safely to the machines. Classical conveyor belt running rules. 3-phase asynchronous motor circuits and safety for voltage drops and voltage fluctuation.


    2nd: BATTERY ID SELECTOR MACHINE (INCI BATTERY)
    Working principle of this machine's is easy. When the all stages is done for battery production, in the last step ID assignment for the battery. A small embedded card was purchased from the outside for the ID printing process. Then, together with my teammate, we connected with the s7-300 PLC to work with the master-slave method. Then we programmed the other necessary steps. (Conveyor belts sensors, and safety instructions.)
    At the end of this work, the design and R&D process of a system that prints the ID information of the batteries whose production processes have been completed and saves them in the system memory has been completed.


    3rd: TILE SORTING MACHINE (GRANISER)
    Tile sorting is the hard thing to do for workers. And doing this by people hand, requires much more time and effort. Than I spoke my chief to this situation and he said me "It bothers me but we couldn't think absoulte solution. Do you have any idea ?". Than i said i need to understand whats the hard point on this side. I went that working field. I saw a few workers separating tiles. And started the speaking one of them. He said this process is very heavy for us because tiles are heavy and requires at least 3-5 workers per shift. And he told me another details. Then i start to design a little bit on my head. When i sure by myself, i went chief engineer. I told about my project. He likes it and give me the job. I did a whole things machine. (E-plan project, PLC Program, Electrical Circuits and little other thing). I can't give details because firm's Privacy Policy. I've successfully did this in 3 months time space. 

    +4th: OLIVE COLOR SORTING MACHINE (FINAL YEAR PROJECT)

## Details about some hobby projects I did when I was a student.
    Different spare times, I studied for little things but expanding my horizons.

1st: HEAT AND HUMIDITY VALUE WORKING WITH ARDUINO-BASED C# AND SQL
    With the arduino i gave heat and humidity values. I write it on serial screen. After that, I created C# form application. I did simple UI for value changes, baund rate and connection things. I gave a try with C# and arduino side. It's working. But one thing to do remain. Database. I searched on the net. Find some valuable information. This side really hard for me but i did it successfully.

2nd: PLC APPLICATIONS
    I searched many applications and tried them on PLCSIM. Generally I use S7-1200 PLC.
